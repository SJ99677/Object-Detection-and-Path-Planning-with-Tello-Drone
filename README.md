# Title: Tello Drone Object Detection and Path Planning

## Introduction
Welcome to the Tello Drone Object Detection and Path Planning project! This project was developed during my 2023 Summer IT Internship at the University of South Carolina Lancaster. Special thanks to Colby Jones and USCL for facilitating this experience!

## Project Description 
This project utilizes Python, specifically the cv2 (OpenCV) module, to implement object detection capabilities. Using this, the Tello drone is equipped to recognize approximately 90 different objects and can draw a rectangle around the detected objects. Additionally, the project incorporates path-planning features to guide the drone along a specified path on a grid. By adjusting the coordinates in the code, you can easily customize the drone's path to suit various requirements.

## Potential Applications/Additions
Surveillance and Security: The object detection capabilities of the Tello drone make it an excellent tool for surveillance and security purposes. It can be deployed in restricted areas or public spaces to monitor and identify potential threats or unauthorized activities.

Multiple Drone Coordination: Enable coordination between multiple Tello drones, allowing them to cover larger areas simultaneously or take over when one is recharging.

Battery Optimization: Implement strategies to optimize the drone's battery usage, extending its flight time and making it more efficient.

Upgrade Past Tello: The DJI Tello drone is good for testing due to the programming capabilities of the drone, its simplicity, and the cost-effective nature of this model. However, it lacks GPS functionality, light-compensation algorithms, etc. A different model could allow for more versatility and fix potential problems.
